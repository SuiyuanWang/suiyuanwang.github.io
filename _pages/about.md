Suiyuan Wang is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Geography at the State University of New York at Buffalo, advised by Dr. Le Wang. Her research and dissertation focus on leveraging knowledge-driven insights from spatial-temporal urban monitoring to promote equitable neighborhood development. She specializes in using advanced geographic information science (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques to monitor urban changes, identify socioeconomic and environmental equity issues, and explore effective strategies for creating sustainable urban environments.

My research interests include: 
- Remote Sensing & GIScience
- Fine-scale Population estimation
- High Spatial & Temporal Urban change detection (Impervious Surfaces) 
- Time-series analysis with cutting-edge Deep Learning methods
